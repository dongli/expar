Introduction
============

The experiment archive is designed to store climate model simulation results so
that the experiments can be inquired later by other reseachers easily. Several
diagnostics (e.g. CLIMO and MJO) can be attached to the experiment, and the
figures can be uploaded. It is a Ruby on Rails (RoR) web application.
